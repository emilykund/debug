<h1/>Debugging</h1>
When it comes to troubleshooting, my friend Mark Kernke asked me one time, “What’s the code trying to do?” 

Because I’m a nerd and like to have some structure, so when I felt lost, I asked Chad (my name for ChatGPT), what a good troubleshooting process would be to debug code for a beginner. So I put that in a checklist and am testing it out (which you can do too).

**This checklist is primarily for coding but it can be used for dataviz calculations too.**  

<h2/>Dataviz Calculations</h2>
- What should this calculation do?

- What is the error message saying?
  
- What seems to be causing the problem? Is there a red squiggly line or some other indicator of the issue?
  
- Did I check how the formula should be structured? Am I using the correct data items with the correct aggregations?
  
- Did I look up the error online?
  
- Did I clean it up and try it again?
